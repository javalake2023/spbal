\title{Extract a sample of a specified size from a master sample.}
\usage{
getSample(shapefile, n, randomStart = FALSE, strata = NULL, stratum = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{shapefile}{A MULTIPOINT or POINT object from where to take the sample.}

\item{n}{The number of sample points to return.}

\item{randomStart}{Whether a spatially balanced sample will be randomly drawn from
the frame or not. Default value is FALSE.}

\item{strata}{to be added}

\item{stratum}{The name of a column in the dataframe attached to shapefile that defines
the strata of interest.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following variable:

\itemize{
\item \code{sample} The sample from the shapefile POINTS.
}

\itemize{
\item \code{getSample(Frame, n)} output the first $n$ points from Frame
\item \code{getSample(Frame, n, randomStart = TRUE)} output $n$ points (in the order of the frame)
}
}
