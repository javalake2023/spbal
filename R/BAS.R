#' @name BAS
#'
#' @title Balanced Acceptance Sampling (BAS).
#'
#' @description BAS draws spatially balanced samples from areal resources. To draw BAS samples,
#' spbal requires a study region shapefile and the regionâ€™s bounding box. An initial sample size
#' is also needed, which can be easily increased or decreased within spbal for master sampling
#' applications
#'
#' @details This function was first written by Paul van Dam-Bates for the
#' package BASMasterSample and later simplified by Phil Davies.
#'
#' @param shapefile Shape file as a polygon (sp or sf) to select sites for.
#' @param n Number of sites to select. If using stratification it is a named vector containing
#' sample sizes of each group.
#' @param boundingbox Bounding box which defines the Master Sample. A bounding box must be
#' supplied.
#' @param minRadius If specified, the minimum distance, in meters, allowed between sample
#' points. This is applied to the $sample points. Points that meet the minRadius criteria
#' are retuned in the minRadius output variable.
#' @param panels A list of integers that define the size of each panel in a
#' non-overlapping panels design. The length of the list determines the number of
#' panels required. The sum of the integers in the panels parameter will determine
#' the total number of samples selected, n. The default value for panels is NULL,
#' this indicates that a non-overlapping panel design is not wanted.
#' @param panel_overlap A list of integers that define the overlap into the previous
#' panel. Is only used when the panels parameter is not NULL. The default value for
#' panel_overlap is NULL. The length of panel_overlap must be equal to the length
#' of panels. The first value is always forced to zero as the first panel never
#' overlaps any region.
#' @param stratum The name of a column in the data.frame attached to shapefile that defines
#' the strata of interest.
#' @param seeds A vector of 2 seeds, u1 and u2. If not specified, the default is NULL and will
#' be defined randomly using function \code{generateUVector}.
#' @param verbose Boolean if you want to see any output printed to screen. Helpful if taking a
#' long time. Default is FALSE i.e. no informational messages are displayed.
#'
#' @return A list containing three variables, \code{$sample} containing locations in the BAS sample,
#' in BAS order, \code{$seeds}, the u1 and u2 seeds used to generate the sample and \code{$minRadius}
#' containing points from $sample that meet the minRadius criteria. If the minRadius
#' parameter is NULL then the $minRadius returned will also be NULL.
#'
#' The sample points are returned in the form of a simple feature collection of POINT objects.
#' They have the following attributes:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item \code{SiteID} A unique identifier for every sample point. This
#'   encodes the BAS order.
#'   \item \code{spbalSeqID} A unique identifier for every sample point. This
#'   encodes the BAS sample order.
#'   \item \code{geometry} The XY co-ordinates of the sample point in the CRS of the original
#'   shapefile.
#' }
