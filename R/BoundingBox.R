# BoundingBox.R

#' @name BoundingBox
#'
#' @title Create a bounding box for a study region.
#'
#' @description Randomly generate a seed from 10,000 possible values in right now 2 dimensions.
#' Note that in van Dam-Bates et al. (2018) we required that the random seed falls into main
#' object shape, such as one of the islands in New Zealand, or within marine environment for
#' BC west coast. However, with a random rotation, we are able to ignore that detail. If this
#' function is used without a random rotation, we recommend running it until
#' the first master sample point does indeed fall within the largest scale of the master sample use.
#'
#' @details This function was first written by Paul van Dam-Bates for the
#' package BASMasterSample and later ported to this package, spbal.
#'
#' @param shapefile Spatial feature that defines the boundary of the area to define a bounding
#' box over.
#' @param d Dimension of the new Master Sample, at this stage we only work with d=2.
#' @param rotate Boolean of whether or not to randomly rotate the bounding box. This parameter
#' is not supported at this time.
#' @param verbose Print the rotation and random seed when it is generated.
#'
#' @return bounding box for a study area.
