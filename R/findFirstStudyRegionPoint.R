# findFirstStudyRegionPoint.R

#' @name findFirstStudyRegionPoint
#'
#' @title Get a randomly chosen Halton point from within the study area and the associated seeds.
#'
#' @description This function repeatedly calls function spbal::getBASSample
#' to generate the Halton frame sample. This function selects the first point at random from those
#' points in the study area. This point and the seeds used to generate the sample are returned to
#' the caller.
#'
#' @details This function was written by Phil Davies.
#'
#' @param shapefile Shape file as a polygon (sp or sf) of the study area(s).
#' @param seeds A vector of 2 seeds, u1 and u2. If not specified, the default is NULL and will
#' be defined randomly using function \code{generateUVector}.
#' @param bb Bounding box which defines the Master Sample. A bounding box must be
#' supplied.
#' @param verbose Boolean if you want to see any output printed to screen. Helpful if taking a
#' long time. Default is FALSE i.e. no informational messages are displayed.
#'
#' @return A list containing three variables:
#'
#' \itemize{
#' \item \code{seeds} The u1 and u2 seeds used to generate the first point.
#' \item \code{k} The index of the first point in the initial sample.
#' }
#'
# 1. Set J1 = 4 and J2 = 3.
# 2. Generate B = 2^J1 x 3^J2 points from a random-start Halton sequence H
#    with a random seed (u1, u2).
# 3. Find points from H in the study area. Call this set S. If S is empty,
#    increment J1 and J2 and go to step 2.
# 4. Randomly choose a point from S. Let xk be this point where k is the 'site index'
#    (I think that's what we call it).
# 5. Set the seed to (u1 + k - 1, u2 + k - 1).
# 6. Re-number ID by subtracting k (re-generate sample using seeds for 5 - first point must also be ID=1)

# For example, let (u1, u2) = (1, 5) and S = {x2, x6, x7}.
# If x6 is randomly chosen, then the new seed is (1 + 6 - 1, 5 + 6 - 1) = (6, 10)
# (the sixth point in H).

# The only difference is that the random-start Halton sequence must be length B.
