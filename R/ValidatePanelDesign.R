# ValidatePanelDesign.R

#' @name ValidatePanelDesign
#'
#' @title Validate the panels and panel_overlap parameters.
#'
#' @description This function is used to validate the panels and panel_overlap
#' parameters. The panel_design flag is set TRUE when the panels and/or panel_overlap
#' parameters are not NULL. This is an internal only function.
#'
#' @details This function was written by Phil Davies.
#'
#' @param panels A list of integers that define the size of each panel in a
#' non-overlapping panels design. The length of the list determines the number of
#' panels required. The sum of the integers in the panels parameter will determine
#' the total number of samples selected, n. The default value for panels is NULL,
#' this indicates that a non-overlapping panel design is not wanted.
#' @param panel_overlap A list of integers that define the overlap into the previous
#' panel. It is only used when the panels parameter is not NULL. The default value for
#' panel_overlap is NULL. The length of panel_overlap must be equal to the length
#' of panels. The first value is always forced to zero as the first panel never
#' overlaps any region.
#' @param n The number of samples required. Only used when panels and panel_overlap are NULL.
#'
#' @return A list containing four variables, they are detailed below.
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item \code{n} When the \code{panels} parameter is not null, the \code{n} parameter is set
#'   using the sum of all the panel sizes in \code{panels}.
#'   \item \code{panel_design} A boolean, TRUE, indicates that the user wants a panels design.
#'   \item \code{number_panels} The number of panels specified in the panel design.
#'   \item \code{panel_overlap} Updated panel_overlap vector, the first element is always forced
#'   to zero irrespective of what the user specified.

#' @name PanelDesignAssignPanelids
#'
#' @title Assign panel ids to the samples.
#'
#' @description This function assigns panel id's to each sample based on values in the
#' panels and panel_overlap parameters. This is an internal only function.
#'
#' @details This function was written by Phil Davies.
#'
#' @param smp The shapefile for the region under study.
#' @param panels A list of integers that defines the size of each panel in a
#' non-overlapping panels design. The length of the list determines the number of
#' panels required. The sum of the integers in the panels parameter will determine
#' the total number of samples selected, n. The default value for panels is NULL,
#' this indicates that a non-overlapping panel design is not wanted.
#' @param panel_overlap A list of integers that define the overlap into the previous
#' panel. Is only used when the panels parameter is not NULL. The default value for
#' panel_overlap is NULL. The length of panel_overlap must be equal to the length
#' of panels. The first value is always forced to zero as the first panel never
#' overlaps any region.
#' @param panel_design A flag, when TRUE, indicates that we are performing a panel design and
#' the parameters used are specified in the panels and panel_overlap parameters.
#' @param number_panels The number of sample panels required.
#' @param verbose Boolean, set TRUE if you want to see output messaged to screen. Default is FALSE
#' i.e. no informational messages are displayed.
#'
#' @return Returns a list of the following variables:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item \code{sample} This is a sample from the original shapefile that has had the
#'    appropriate panel id's add as a feature. The panel id values are determined by the
#'    panels and panel_overlap parameters.
