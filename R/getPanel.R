#' @name contains_feature
#'
#' @title Check if the sf object contains a specified feature.
#'
#' @description Used to check if a simple file object contains a feature. This
#' is an internal only function.
#'
#' @details This function was written by Phil Davies.
#'
#' @param sf_object Simple file object that we want to verify if it contains
#' a feature called feature_name.
#' @param feature_name The feature name we want to find in the simple file
#' object sf_object.
#'
#' @return Returns TRUE if the simple file object sf_object contains the feature
#' feature_name. Otherwise FALSE is returned.
#'
#' @keywords internal

  # Drop the geometry column

}


#' @name getPanel
#'
#' @title Extract all points with a specified panel id from a sample.
#'
#' @description This is the main function for selecting sites using the BAS master
#' sample. It assumes that you have already defined the master sample using the
#' BoundingBox() function or will be selecting a marine master sample site in BC.
#'
#' @details This function was written by Phil Davies.
#'
#' @param shapefile Shape file as a polygon (sp or sf) containing a sample that
#' contains a feature column named panel_id.
#' @param panelid The overlapped panel in the shapefile shp the user wants
#' sample points from.
#'
#' @return The sample for the specified panel.
